**Statement:** the smallest standalone element of a program.\

**Scope of a variable:** where you can access the variable.\
**Primitive data type:** is a basic data type build into the language. \

<li> Entry point is func main which needs to be in package main </li>
<li> fmt.Println() is println function from fmt package package-dot-identifier syntax</li>
<li> Identifier is the name of a variable/constant/function</li>
<li> _ char is the throw away returns character.</li>
<li> If a func takes ...interface{} parameter aka variadic parameter, func can take as many values of that type as you pass in</li>
